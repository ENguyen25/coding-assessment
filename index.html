            <p class="regular-white-text">Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in games. Remember how
                much fun you had growing up when you used to just go outside and play with your
                friends? We advocate using the "compete to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play
                and have fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive drills, does a
                better job of preparing players to compete in real games. Technically, this is called
                transference. What you do in practice carries over into what you do in games.</p>

            <p class="regular-white-text">Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble knockout are very
                popular. Every player must have his or her own basketball. Coach starts the game. Every
                player must dribble constantly, stay in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from all
                other players in the game. Lose control of your basketball or go out-of-bounds, and
                you're eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players could start as half the court. After
                several players are eliminated, the boundary is reduced to only inside the 3-point area.
                Boundary is reduced again to the free-throw lane. Finally, when there are just two
                players left, they play the "finals" in the free throw half circle.
